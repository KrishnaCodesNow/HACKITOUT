# ServiceHub – Hyperlocal Service Discovery Web App 🛠️📍

**ServiceHub** is a hyperlocal web application built during a hackathon to help people quickly find and book trusted service professionals within their own locality. It focuses on everyday and emergency services such as electricians, plumbers, painters, housekeeping, tutors, mechanics, catering, and general repairs.

The platform prioritizes nearby availability, faster response times, and user safety, making it especially useful during urgent situations. Unlike large aggregator platforms, ServiceHub is designed with a **locality-first approach**, connecting users with nearby providers to reduce wait times and improve trust while empowering local workers.
